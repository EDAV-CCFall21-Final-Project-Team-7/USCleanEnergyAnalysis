Renewable energy sources include wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric power sources. It is interesting to note that Vermont is already generating 100% of their power from renewable energy sources. Additionally, Delaware has the lower percentage of power generated from renewables with these sources comprising just over 2% of the average 2020 power. Some states have set Renewable Portfolio Goals (RPS) that specify that utilities must sell a certain percentage of electricity that is generated from renewable sources. Delaware set a goal in 2005 to achieve achieve power generation that is 25% renewables by 2025 (https://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/renewable-portfolio-standards.aspx); however, they have only achieved 2% renewables in the current year. 5.2 Macro Trends To explore macro trends in the energy sources utilized by the United States as a whole, the time series for each power source is plotted from 2001 - 2021. It is seen below that in 2001 coal was the predominant electricity source for America. Coal had a steady power generation until it began to decline around 2010. Natural gas took off at this time and by 2021 is the biggest producer of energy. Conventional hydroelectric was one of the first renewable energy resources to appear at significant levels in the electricity power generation for the US. Both solar and wind power have slowly increased in the amount of power they produce. We can explore the relationship between specific fuel types to determine which are correlated. From the plot below, it appears that coal is negatively correlated with both solar and natural gas. This is not necessarily surprising because natural gas is typically used to complement renewable energy sources and act as a form of stability to produce power when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. We can explore the relationship between specific fuel types to determine which are correlated. From the plot below, we can see that solar is negatively correlated with coal and positively correlated with natural gas and wind. This is not necessarily surprising because natural gas is typically used to complement variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind and act as a form of stability to produce power when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. It makes sense that as the adoption of wind and solar energy increases, natural gas usage will also increase until a cleaner alternative is found. Natural gas is a cleaner fuel source than coal and produces 50% less CO_2 emissions (https://group.met.com/fyouture/natural-gas-vs-coal/66). However, the cleanest alternative would be another renewable energy source that could help address the variability in production of wind and solar, like batteries. To explore the seasonal component, look at the seasonplot for 2015-2021 when solar was adopted more widely as a fuel type. The solar power net generation seasonal trend peaks in the summer months (May - August) and dip in the winter months. This is most likely due to the fact that there is more sunshine in the summer months, so more solar power is able to be generated. The coal plot shows the power generation trends overall. There is a peak in June - September and December - February. These peaks make sense because these are the times of year that energy demand is at the highest due to heating demand during the cold months and cooling demand during the hot months. In the seasonal plot, we can see that solar is increasing in production from 2015-201, while coal is decreasing in production. The most noticeable change in primary fuels can be seen from coal and natural gas. In 2001, 32 states used coal as the primary fuel, while by 2020 this number changed to 11. Natural gas experienced the opposite trend where it grew from being the primary fuel for 7 states to 22. nuclear, hydroelectric, and petroleum liquids were also primary fuels for states in 2001 and 2020. These fuels did not see much change in number of states using them as their primary fuel. Renewables (other than hydroelectric) did become the primary fuel for 4 states (Iowa, Kansas, Maine, and Minnesota) in 2020, while in 2001 no states were using other renewables as the primary fuel. 5.3 Correlation of Energy Consumption, CO2 Emission and Economic Indicators 5.4 Correlation between Energy ETF and macro trends in energy "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
